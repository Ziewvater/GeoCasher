typealias LocationClosureType = (location: CLLocation) -> Void

/**
Handles asking for location permission, returning current location.
Subclasses NSObject to conform to CLLocationManagerDelegate

The LocationPermissionHandler performs the necessary actions required to request access to location data for the app. It also handles presenting descriptive alert views to prime the user for granting location data access (as http://www.useronboard.com/ advises).

Wrapping this process allows us to react to permission denials where we would normally miss them since successive calls to `CLLocationManager.request*Authorization()` fail silently when permission is denied. We could just try immediately asking for location services permissions when authorization status is .NotDetermined, and this process would still work, but I think adding the priming alert makes the app experience more conversational and friendly, even if it means we're showing two alerts in a row.
